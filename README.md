# Socio-Behavioral_trends
Thesis paper abstract
This research aims to explore the application of machine learning models, specifically BERTopic and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), 
for the analysis and prediction of socio-behavioural trends in the context of business operations. The goal is to investigate the potential of these models in identifying and 
analysing consumer behaviour patterns, enabling businesses to enhance marketing strategies and decision-making processes. The findings highlight the effectiveness of BERTopic 
and LDA in uncovering hidden trends, understanding customer preferences and sentiments, and optimizing marketing campaigns. The implications suggest that adopting these machine 
learning models can lead to increased sales, improved customer satisfaction, enhanced operational efficiency, and cost savings for businesses. 
The research also addresses the limitations and ethical considerations associated with using machine learning in consumer behaviour analysis. By examining the application of machine 
learning models, including BERTopic and LDA, in the analysis and prediction of socio-behavioural trends, this research contributes to the growing body of knowledge in the field.
